This is a simple socket server which can be used to capture HTTP
requests. This is a core component used in ECHO Proxy Server testing
framework[1]. Point a client to the Echo server and do a HTTP request
the reply will be the HTTP request received by the echo server. This is
helpful to know the actual request and can be used for testing.
